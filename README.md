Challenge | Website for a mobile service provider
'BLABSLAB' is a new mobile service provider on the market and are looking for a cool, new website. 'BLABSLAB' offers both a contracted and pay-as-you-go mobile service; for which their customers should be able to check their usage, remaining minutes and purchase more credit over their webpage.

They really love interactive elements on the page and big, bold colors. This must be an active,  bright and happy website. The user's journey to either the pay-as-you-go or contract areas of the website must be shown.
